                A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
            </strong> Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and <br />
            mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use <em>
                during the 20th century, and
                developed economies depend on them
            </em>. The benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility,independence
            and convenience.The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the
            automotive industry, transportation, provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the taxes.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed — and quite possibly built — by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672.
            It was a 65-cm-long scale-model toy for the Chinese Emperor <strong>
                that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.It is not known with certainty if
                Verbiest's model was successfully built or ran.
            </strong>

            The development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the <a href=" =https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_car">history of the car</a>, but often treated
            separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars,
            steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. Sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.
